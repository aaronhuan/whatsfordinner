## AI usage 
ChatGPT and the built-in google gemini on android studio aided this assignment question.
The main usage was to figure out navigation's and styling.
Some examples would be: 
- "How to navigate using {id}?"
- "How do I use stack in my navigation?"
- "How to style screens using Scaffold and BottomNavigation?"


## AI misunderstanding navigation
There were some misunderstandings when AI assisted. 
One notable issue was when it made it so that clicking on "Home" redirected to the newly added recipe's
home page. And it would stay that page no mater how much you click on "Home" or how many recipes you add.
This was due to the incorrect usage of the stack when returning Home
